Containing zipped examples of projects you can use to play around with [*refinery*](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery).

Each project is in a dedicated branch and follows the following pattern:
- `README.md`: short description of the project and the raw data
- `snapshot_data.json.zip`: project export of the use case which you can import as a snapshot to your local *refinery*.
- some branches additionally contain information about e.g. how you can scrape the initial data or how to export the final data to be used for a different framework.

Currently, we have the following use cases:
- [Conversational AI](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/sample-projects/tree/conversational-ai): `git clone -b conversational-ai https://github.com/code-kern-ai/sample-projects.git`
- [Sentiment prediction stock news](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/sample-projects/tree/sentiment-analysis-stock-news): `git clone -b sentiment-analysis-stock-news https://github.com/code-kern-ai/sample-projects.git`
- [Finetuning similarity search](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/sample-projects/tree/finetuning-similarity-search): `git clone -b finetuning-similarity-search https://github.com/code-kern-ai/sample-projects.git`

You can either clone the whole repository, or one specific branch (recommended).

If you want to provide your own project as a sample project in this repository, please reach out to us.
