Containing project examples you can use to play around with [*refinery*](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery).

**Each project is in a dedicated branch and follows the pattern:**
- `README.md`: short description of the project and the raw data
- `snapshot_data.json.zip`: project export of the use case which you can import as a snapshot to your local *refinery*.
- some branches additionally contain information about e.g. how you can scrape the initial data or how to export the final data to be used for a different framework.
